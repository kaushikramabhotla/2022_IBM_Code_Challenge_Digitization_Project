## Project Description
* This project is a part of IBM's Good Tech Scholar Program. We chose the problem statement -"Digitization to ease access to social services". The idea is to make Indian governmental services accessible to common people via an interface like mobile app/ web application.

## Solution Description
* Our team tried to create an all-in-one web application which gives users the ease of accessing all the governmental services like -"Land conversion", "Pension application" etc.. For storing the data, we have used sqlite database software. We have used JDBC driver inorder to make a connection between Java & the database software.
